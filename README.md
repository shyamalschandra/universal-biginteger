## Universal BigInteger Class: Comparison & Analysis
Created by: Shyamal Suhana Chandra

The universal big integer class library was created to:

1. Showcase each langauge's pros and cons w.r.t. performance, usability, and ease-of-use

2. Benchmark the runtime performance on a variety of operations in order to pick a winner

3. Develop new representations of the bigintegers for future projects

4. Research the latest and greatest operations for optimized asymptotic and real runtime
